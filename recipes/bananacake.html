<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Remember that time I told you about the best banana cake I’ve ever had?</p>
<p>obsessed over it at a family reunion the other weekend. My cousin made it and I stalked her down like a dessert creep and proceeded to talk her ear off about cream cheese frosting and spotty bananas for 35 minutes straight.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3 large ripe bananas</li>
    <li>3 cups (375g) all-purpose flour </li>
    <li>unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda/li>
    <li>3 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Make the cake: Mash the bananas. I usually just use my mixer for this! Set mashed bananas aside.</li>
    <li>Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on high speed until smooth and creamy – about 1 minute. Add both sugars and beat on high speed for 2 minutes until creamed together. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed.</li>
    <li>Cover leftover cake tightly and store in the refrigerator for 5 days.</li>
    
</ol>
