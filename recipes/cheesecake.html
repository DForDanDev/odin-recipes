<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Look no further for a creamy and ultra smooth classic cheesecake recipe! Paired with a buttery graham cracker crust!</p>
<p>No one can deny its simple decadence. For the best results, bake in a water bath.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Four 8-ounce blocks (904g) full-fat cream cheese, softened to room temperature</li>
    <li>sugar</li>
    <li>1 cup (240g) full-fat sour cream, at room temperature</li>
    <li>baking powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
    <li>3 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
    <li>vanilla extract</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed in a large bowl until the mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the sour cream, vanilla extract, and lemon juice then beat until fully combined. On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition until just blended. After the final egg is incorporated into the batter, stop mixing. To help prevent the cheesecake from deflating and cracking as it cools, avoid over-mixing the batter as best you can.</li>
    <li>Boil a pot of water. You need 1 inch of water in your roasting pan for the water bath, so make sure you boil enough. I use an entire kettle of hot water. As the water is heating up, wrap the aluminum foil around the springform pan. Pour the cheesecake batter on top of the crust.</li>
    <li>Use a knife to loosen the chilled cheesecake from the rim of the springform pan, then remove the rim. Using a clean sharp knife, cut into slices for serving. For neat slices, wipe the knife clean and dip into warm water between each slice.</li>
